# Smash Lab Stringing

Badminton stringing service site with an interactive "Find Your Perfect String" quiz that recommends a string + tension setup, plus a full browsable string comparison catalog.

Stack: **Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion**. No backend — everything runs client-side from a couple of local data/config files.

## Running the project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # start local dev server
npm run build     # type-check + production build to dist/
npm run lint      # oxlint
npm run preview   # preview the production build
```

## Where things live

```
src/
  data/
    strings.ts          # THE string database — edit prices, stock, ratings, colors, notes here
    quizQuestions.ts     # quiz copy: question text, options, emoji
  config/
    recommendationWeights.ts  # how each quiz answer nudges the string-matching score
    tensionRules.ts           # base tension ranges, goal/feel adjustments, safety margins
  logic/
    recommendationEngine.ts   # scores every string against a player's answers (pure functions)
    tensionRecommendation.ts  # tension math, separate from string scoring
    pricing.ts                # €15 service fee + string cost → total
    units.ts                  # kg ⇄ lbs conversion
  components/
    StringFinder.tsx          # quiz orchestrator (steps, back/forward, phases)
    QuizQuestion.tsx           # generic single-select question card
    TensionInputStep.tsx       # numeric tension entry w/ unit toggle
    CalculatingAnimation.tsx
    RecommendationResult.tsx   # the final "match card" reveal
    StringCard.tsx / StatBars.tsx / StockBadge.tsx
    StringComparison.tsx       # filterable browse-all-strings page
    Hero.tsx, HowItWorks.tsx, PricingSection.tsx, WhyUs.tsx, FAQ.tsx, Contact.tsx, Nav.tsx, Footer.tsx
```

## Editing things later

- **Add/remove a string, change stock or price**: edit the array in `src/data/strings.ts`. Nothing else needs touching — cards, filters, the quiz, and pricing all read from this one file.
- **Change the €15 service fee**: `STRINGING_SERVICE_FEE` in `src/logic/pricing.ts`.
- **Tune how quiz answers affect string recommendations**: `src/config/recommendationWeights.ts` — every answer maps to small +/- nudges across five dimensions (repulsion, durability, hitting sound, shock absorption, control). Bigger number = stronger pull toward strings that score well there.
- **Tune tension logic**: `src/config/tensionRules.ts` — base ranges per level, nudges for stated goal/current-tension feel, safety margins.
- **Add a new quiz question**: add it to `src/data/quizQuestions.ts`, add its id to the step list in `src/components/StringFinder.tsx` (`buildSteps`), and add scoring contributions in `recommendationWeights.ts` if it should affect the match.
- **Contact details**: `src/components/Contact.tsx` — currently placeholder info.

## Assumptions made

- Contact info (WhatsApp/email/location/Instagram) is placeholder — swap in `Contact.tsx`.
- Availability nudges ranking (in-stock > low-stock > unavailable) but never overrides a clearly better performance match by more than a few points, per the spec.
- No price weighting is baked into the match score itself, so expensive strings never get an automatic edge — the "worth considering" third pick can surface a cheaper alternative when it's a meaningfully different fit.
- Tension is stored internally in kg everywhere and converted to lbs only for display.
